# Flexion Mobile Limited Test Challenge

## Description

This is my solution for the Java challenge test at Flexion Mobile Limited.
It was about implementing some functionalities including buying, getting all purchases and consuming purhase(s).
Besides the implementation, there is a test case to verify that the solution works correctly.
The implementation is a maven project.
